# Application's Purpose

This repo will contain two files, planet.py and README.md. Planet.py includes all of the source code for the planet simulation. This simulation only includes a few planets but can be easily modifed to include many more. 

# Files
1. planet.py
2. README.md

# Known Errors
No known errors

# References

* I used the following tutorial to create this program.
